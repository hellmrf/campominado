# Campo Minado
Cl√°ssico Campo Minado implementado em Javascript.

## How to use
1. Clone or download `minesweeper.js` and include it in your HTML;
2. Create a `<table>` with some `id`
3. In your javascript, call `minesweeper(ref,width,height,bombs);`, where `ref` is your table object, `width` is the number of horizontal cells in the game, `height` is analogue of width and `bombs` is the number of generated bombs.
It'll just print some `<tr>` and `<td>`, so you have to style it (or just clone the entire repository).
